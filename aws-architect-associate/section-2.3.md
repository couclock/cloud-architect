Here’s the transcript:

## EBS Volumes

- ⭐ **EBS = Elastic Block Store**
  - Network-attached block storage for EC2
  - Persistent data across instance stops/terminations (if allowed)
  - AZ-scoped → must be in same **AZ** as EC2 to attach
  - One EC2 ↔ one EBS (single attach) at SAA level
  - Multiple EBS → single EC2 allowed

- 🔌 **Key Concepts**
  - “Network USB stick” → network latency vs instance store
  - Detach/attach quickly → useful for failover
  - Must **provision size + IOPS** upfront (GP2/GP3, etc.)
  - Pay for provisioned capacity
  - Volumes can exist **unattached**

- 🔄 **Snapshots**
  - Needed to move EBS across AZ/Region
  - Stored in S3 (managed by AWS, not directly visible)

- 🏷️ **Delete on Termination**
  - **Root volume: YES by default**
  - **Additional volumes: NO by default**
  - Controls whether EBS is removed when EC2 terminates
  - Exam tip: disable it to **preserve root disk** after termination

- 📌 **Exam Tips**
  - EBS must match **same AZ** as EC2 to attach
  - Can attach/detach live
  - Terminated EC2 → root EBS deleted (default), non-root kept
  - Snapshot → create volume in another AZ
  - EBS = block storage; use when filesystem-level access required

- 🛠️ **Use Cases**
  - Root volumes, databases, OS disks, apps needing persistence
  - Failover via detaching/attaching to new EC2 (same AZ)

## EBS Snapshots

### 📸 Core Concepts
- Point-in-time backup of **EBS volumes**
- 💡 No need to detach volume (but recommended)
- Copy snapshots **across AZs/Regions**
- Restore snapshot → create new EBS volume in any AZ

### 🧩 Key Features
- **Archive Tier**  
  - Up to **75% cheaper**  
  - Restore delay **24–72 hrs**

- **Recycle Bin**  
  - Protects from accidental deletion  
  - Retention: **1 day–1 year**  
  - Supports EBS snapshots + AMIs

- **Fast Snapshot Restore (FSR)**  
  - Pre-initializes snapshot → ⚡ zero-latency first use  
  - Costly; use for large/critical restores

### 📝 Exam Tips
- Snapshots are **incremental** (only changes stored)  
- Needed to **move EBS volume across AZ**  
- Useful for **DR** via cross-region copy  
- Snapshots support **encryption** (and inherit encryption)

### 🧠 Ops Notes
- Create Volume from Snapshot → choose **any AZ**  
- Archive snapshots require waiting before restore  
- Recycle Bin gives recoverability; rules can be resource-wide

## AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)

### 📦 Core Concepts
- AMI = **preconfigured image** to launch EC2 instances  
- Contains: OS, software, configs, monitoring, dependencies  
- 🚀 Faster boot + consistent configuration  
- AMIs are **region-specific**, but can be **copied cross-region**

### 🧩 AMI Types
- **Public AMIs** (AWS-provided: e.g., Amazon Linux 2)  
- **Custom AMIs** (user-created; must maintain yourself)  
- **Marketplace AMIs** (vendor-built, paid or free)

### 🛠️ AMI Creation Workflow
1. Launch EC2  
2. Customize instance (install software, configs)  
3. **Stop instance** (recommended for data integrity)  
4. Create AMI → generates **EBS snapshots**  
5. Launch new instances from AMI (any AZ in same region)

### 📝 Exam Tips
- AMIs are **regional**; snapshots enable **cross-region** copy → DR  
- Best for fleets needing consistent setup + fast scaling  
- Update AMIs when patching OS/software  
- Marketplace AMIs may incur extra cost  
- AMI contains **root volume** snapshot; additional volumes optional

### ⚙️ Operational Notes
- Launching from AMI = no need to reinstall software → faster initialization  
- Combine AMI + user data for light final config  
- Custom AMIs help auto-scale groups launch quicker

## EC2 Instance Store

### ⚡ Core Concepts
- High-performance **local NVMe/SATA storage** physically attached to the EC2 host  
- Offers extremely high IOPS & throughput vs EBS  
- **Ephemeral**: data lost on **stop, terminate, or host failure**

### 🧩 Use Cases
- 🚀 Ultra-fast temporary storage  
- Cache, buffer, scratch space  
- High-speed processing workloads  
- NOT for durable data

### 🛑 Limitations
- No persistence; must manage your own backup/replication  
- Tied to the *specific host* → data disappears if instance is stopped

### 📝 Exam Tips
- “Need millions of IOPS / ultra-high disk performance” → **Instance Store**  
- “Need persistence & durability” → **EBS**  
- Instance families like **I3 / I4** commonly include Instance Store  
- Stopping instance ≠ reboot: **stop = data loss**, reboot = data preserved (unless host changes)

### 📈 Performance Context
- Instance Store can hit **>3M IOPS**, far beyond GP2/GP3 limits  
- Always ephemeral → never store critical data without replication

## EBS Volumes & Volume Types

So, now, let's talk about EBS volumes and their different volume types. They come in six different types today, and we can group them in several categories.

### General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3)
These balance price and performance for a wide variety of workloads.

- **gp2** and **gp3** are used for general-purpose workloads.
- Can be used as **boot volumes**.
- **gp3** (newest generation):
  - Baseline: **3000 IOPS**, **125 MB/s throughput**
  - Can increase up to **16,000 IOPS** and **1000 MB/s throughput** independently
- **gp2**:
  - Small volumes can burst up to **3000 IOPS**
  - IOPS scales with size (**3 IOPS per GB**) up to **16,000 IOPS**

**Key takeaway:**  
gp3 lets you configure IOPS and throughput independently, while gp2 links performance to volume size.

### Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1, io2 / io2 Block Express)
Used for **critical, low-latency, high-performance workloads**, including databases.

- **io1**:
  - Size: 4–16 TB
  - Max IOPS: **64,000** on Nitro EC2 / **32,000** otherwise
  - IOPS can be provisioned independently of size

- **io2 Block Express**:
  - Size up to **64 TB**
  - Sub-millisecond latency
  - Max IOPS: **256,000**
  - IOPS-to-size ratio: **1000:1**
  - Supports **EBS Multi-Attach**

### HDD Volumes (st1, sc1)
Cannot be used as boot volumes. Used for throughput-intensive or cold data workloads.

- **st1 (Throughput-Optimized HDD)**:
  - For big data, data warehousing, log processing
  - Max throughput: **500 MB/s**
  - Max IOPS: **500**

- **sc1 (Cold HDD)**:
  - Lowest-cost option, for infrequently accessed data
  - Max throughput: **250 MB/s**
  - Max IOPS: **250**

### Summary
You do **not** need to memorize all numbers for the exam; just understand when to use each type:
- **gp2/gp3** → general purpose, cost-effective
- **io1/io2** → provisioned IOPS, high-performance workloads (DBs)
- **st1/sc1** → throughput or cold data at low cost

If you need **more than 32,000 IOPS**, you must use **EC2 Nitro + io1/io2**.

## Multi-Attach Feature

The **Multi-Attach** feature allows the **same EBS volume** to be attached to **multiple EC2 instances** *in the same Availability Zone*.

### Key Points
- Only supported on **io1** and **io2** volumes.
- Allows **full read/write access** from multiple instances simultaneously.
- Useful for:
  - Clustered Linux applications
  - Applications needing concurrent write operations
- Maximum of **16 EC2 instances** per volume.
- Requires a **cluster-aware file system** (not xfs/ext4).
- Cannot attach across different AZs.

## EBS Encryption

🔐 **Basics**
- Encrypt at creation → data at rest + in-flight encrypted  
- Snapshots + child volumes inherit encryption  
- AES-256 via KMS, transparent, minimal latency  

🛠️ **Encrypt Existing Unencrypted Volume**
1. Create snapshot (unencrypted)  
2. Copy snapshot → **Enable encryption** (pick KMS key)  
3. Create volume from encrypted snapshot  
4. Attach new encrypted volume to instance  

⚡ **Shortcut**
- From unencrypted snapshot → *Create Volume* → toggle **Enable Encryption**

📌 **Exam Tips**
- Encryption state propagates vol → snap → vol  
- Cannot directly encrypt an existing volume  
- Snapshot copy (incl. cross-region) can enable encryption  
- KMS CMK or AWS-managed key required

## Amazon EFS

📌 **Core**
- Managed **NFS** (POSIX) shared file system
- Mount across **multiple AZs** + many EC2 instances
- **Linux-only** (not Windows)
- **Pay-per-use**, auto-scaling to PBs
- More expensive than EBS (~3× GP2)

🔐 **Security**
- Uses **security groups** (NFS port 2049)
- **KMS encryption at rest**
- SG on EFS must allow inbound NFS from EC2 SGs

🗂️ **Use Cases**
- Web/CMS (WordPress), shared content, data sharing

⚡ **Performance Modes**
- **General Purpose** (default) → low latency (web apps)
- **Max I/O** → high throughput, high latency (big data)

🚀 **Throughput Modes**
- **Bursting** → scales w/ storage size
- **Provisioned** → set throughput explicitly (pay up front)
- **Elastic (recommended)** → auto-scale up/down to workload

📦 **Storage Classes**
- **Standard** → frequent access, multi-AZ
- **IA (Infrequent Access)** → cheaper storage, retrieval cost  
- **Archive** → rarely accessed, lowest cost  
- **One Zone / One Zone-IA** → single AZ, cheaper dev/test
- **Lifecycle mgmt** → auto-move files between tiers (e.g., 30d → IA, 90d → Archive, access → Standard)

🛠️ **Architecture Tips**
- Use **Regional** EFS for production (multi-AZ resilience)
- **One Zone** for dev/cost-sensitive
- Thousands of NFS clients, 10+ GB/s throughput possible

🔧 **Mounting**
- EC2 console can auto-mount via user data
- EFS creates mount targets in **each AZ**
- Ensure EC2 uses correct SG allowing NFS to EFS SG

📘 **Exam Tips**
- EFS = **shared, scalable, multi-AZ NFS**
- Linux-only, POSIX compliant
- Autoscaling, pay-per-use differentiates from EBS/FSx
- Select correct **performance + throughput** combo per workload
