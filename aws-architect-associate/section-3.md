## Scalability & High Availability

### 🔼 Vertical Scaling (Scale Up/Down)
- Increase instance size (e.g., t2.micro → t2.large)
- Used for non-distributed systems (DBs: RDS, ElastiCache)
- Limited by hardware ceilings
- Simple but not fault-tolerant

### ➕ Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out/In)
- Add/remove instances → distributed systems
- Common for web/modern apps
- Requires stateless design for best results
- Uses Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) + Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

### 🟢 High Availability (HA)
- Run across ≥2 AZs to survive AZ failure
- HA ≠ scalability (often paired but independent)
- Active-active: multiple AZs serving traffic
- Passive: e.g., RDS Multi-AZ standby

### 🛠 EC2 Scaling Terms
- **Scale Up/Down**: vertical (instance size)
- **Scale Out/In**: horizontal (instance count)
- ASG must span Multi-AZ for HA
- ELB distributes traffic across Multi-AZ targets

### 📝 Exam Tips
- Vertical = bigger box; Horizontal = more boxes
- HA always implies Multi-AZ
- Horizontal scaling requires distributed/stateless design
- ASG + ELB = scalability + HA
- RDS Multi-AZ = HA but **not** read scaling (use Read Replicas)

## Elastic Load Balancing overview
### 🎯 Purpose
- Distribute traffic across multiple EC2/backends
- Single public endpoint; users unaware of backend targets
- Enables HA, fault tolerance, scalability

### 🔍 Why Use ELB
- Spread load across instances
- Health checks → route only to healthy targets
- SSL/TLS termination
- Session stickiness (cookies)
- Multi-AZ support
- Public vs internal LB
- Deep AWS integration: ASG, ECS, ACM, CW, R53, WAF, GA

### ❤️ Health Checks
- Protocol + Port + Path (e.g., HTTP:4567/health)
- Must return 200 OK → else instance marked unhealthy
- LB stops routing to unhealthy targets

### ⚙️ Managed ELB Types
- **CLB (old, deprecated)**: HTTP/HTTPS, TCP/SSL  
- **ALB (L7)**: HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket  
- **NLB (L4)**: TCP/TLS/UDP, ultra-fast, static IP  
- **GWLB (L3)**: IP-level, appliance insertion (firewalls, etc.)
- Prefer newer generation (ALB/NLB/GWLB)

### 🔐 Security Groups
- **LB SG**: allow 0.0.0.0/0 on 80/443
- **EC2 SG**: allow only LB SG as source on app port (e.g., 80)
- Ensures traffic flows *only* through LB

### 📝 Exam Tips
- ALB = L7, path/host-based routing  
- NLB = L4, extreme performance, static IP  
- Health checks critical for ASG + ELB  
- Internal LBs for private traffic; external for internet-facing

## Application Load Balancer (ALB)

### 🌐 Overview
- L7 (HTTP/HTTPS only), supports HTTP/2 + WebSockets
- Routes traffic to **Target Groups**
- One ALB → many apps/microservices
- Ideal for microservices, containers (ECS), Lambda

### 🎯 Routing Features
- **Path-based** (/users → TG1, /search → TG2)
- **Host-based** (a.example.com → TG1, b.example.com → TG2)
- **Query/Headers** (e.g., ?Platform=Mobile)
- **Redirects** (HTTP→HTTPS)
- **Fixed responses** (custom 4xx/5xx)

### 🎯 Target Groups
- Types:
  - EC2 instances (w/ ASG)
  - ECS tasks (dynamic port mapping)
  - Lambda functions (serverless)
  - Private IPs (on-prem)
- Health checks defined **per TG**
- ALB picks only healthy targets

### 🧱 Architecture Benefits
- One ALB replaces multiple CLBs
- Perfect for multiple apps on one host (containers)
- Smart routing → microservice patterns

### 🔐 Security
- LB SG: allow 0.0.0.0/0 on 80/443
- EC2 SG: allow only LB SG as source
- Enforces traffic **through** ALB only

### 🧾 X-Forwarded Headers
- `X-Forwarded-For`: Client IP
- `X-Forwarded-Port`: Port
- `X-Forwarded-Proto`: HTTP/HTTPS
- Needed because ALB terminates connections

### 🗂 Listener Rules
- Conditions: Host, Path, Method, Source IP, Headers, Query
- Actions: Forward → TGs, Redirect, Fixed response
- Priorities determine rule evaluation order
- Default rule catches unmatched requests

### 📝 Exam Tips
- ALB = L7, intelligent routing (path/host/query)
- Supports ECS dynamic ports → **critical SAA concept**
- ALB can front Lambda → serverless HTTP ingress
- Health checks always at TG level
- ALB DNS name fixed; no static IP (use NLB if needed)

## Network Load Balancer (NLB)

- ⭐ **Layer 4 LB** → TCP / UDP (not HTTP). Low-level, ultra-fast, millions RPS, ultra-low latency.
- ⭐ **Exam trigger**: UDP ✔️ | Extreme performance ✔️ | Static IPs ✔️ → Think **NLB**.

### 🧩 Architecture & Features
- One **static IP per AZ** (can assign **Elastic IPs**).
- Use when app must expose **fixed IPs**.
- Supports **TCP, UDP, TLS, TCP_UDP** listeners.
- Target groups:
  - EC2 instances
  - **IP addresses** (must be private, hard-coded; supports on-prem IPs → hybrid)
  - Another **ALB** (NLB → ALB for static IPs + L7 rules)
- NLB health checks: **TCP / HTTP / HTTPS**.

### ⚙️ SG & Connectivity
- NLB now supports **security groups** (newer feature).
- Backend EC2 SG must **allow inbound** from NLB SG (common exam trap).
- If health checks fail → usually missing SG rule from NLB to targets.

### 🧪 Setup Essentials (SAA exam focus)
- Internet-facing or internal.
- One IP per enabled AZ (AWS-assigned or Elastic IP you choose).
- Listener example: TCP:80 → TG on TCP:80.
- For HTTP app behind NLB: use **HTTP** health checks for accuracy.

### 🏁 Tips
- Hybrid architectures → register private on-prem IPs.
- Need static whitelisted IPs → NLB.
- Need L7 routing + static IP → **NLB in front of ALB**.
- Always check SGs: allow NLB → EC2 for data + health check ports.

## Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

- ⭐ **Use case**: Insert **firewalls / IDS / IPS / DPI** appliances into all VPC traffic.
- ⭐ Exam trigger: **GENEVE protocol (6081)** → GWLB.

### 🧩 Core Concepts
- **Layer 3 (network layer)** LB → handles **IP packets**.
- Combines:
  - **Transparent gateway** (single entry/exit for all traffic)
  - **Load balancer** (distributes traffic across appliance fleet)

### 🔄 Traffic Flow
1. User traffic → **GWLB**
2. GWLB → **virtual appliances** (EC2 or private IPs)
3. Appliances inspect traffic (allow/drop)
4. Approved traffic → back through GWLB → application  
   → **Transparent to the app**

### 🗂️ Target Groups
- EC2 instances (instance ID)
- Private IPs (incl. on-prem appliances)

### 📌 Key Benefits
- Centralize & scale network security appliances
- Simplifies routing: GWLB updates VPC route tables
- Drop or modify packets before reaching workloads

### 🏁 Tips
- Need traffic inspection at L3 → **GWLB**
- Hybrid security appliances? Use **IP target registration**
- No deep config questions on exam—know **diagram & use case**

## ELB Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)
- 🔁 **Sticky Sessions** = Same client → same backend instance  
- Supported by **CLB**, **ALB**, **NLB**

- ⭐ **Why**  
  - Keep user session on same instance (e.g., login state)  
  - Risk: ⚠️ uneven load if “sticky” users

- 🍪 **How**  
  - Via **cookies** (sent back to LB, then to instance) **except for NLB**

- 🍪 Types of Cookies
  - **Application-based cookie**
    - Generated by **application / target**
    - Custom attributes allowed  
    - Must specify cookie name per target group  
    - ❌ Do NOT use reserved names: `AWSALB`, `AWSALBAPP`, `AWSALBTG`
    - ALB app cookie created by LB: `AWSALBAPP`

  - **Duration-based cookie**
    - Generated by **load balancer**
    - Names:  
      - ALB → `AWSALB`  
      - CLB → `AWSELB`  
    - Expiry = fixed duration (1s–7d)

- ⚙️ **Configuration**
  - Set at **Target Group → Attributes → Stickiness**
  - Modes:  
    - **LB-generated cookie** (set duration)  
    - **Application cookie** (provide name)

- ⛔ When cookie expires → client rebalanced to another instance

## Cross-Zone Load Balancing (XZLB)

- 🎯 **Goal**: Distribute traffic evenly across all registered targets in all AZs

- 🔄 **With XZLB ON**
  - Each LB node sends traffic evenly to **all** targets (all AZs)
  - Fixes uneven AZ target counts (e.g., 2 vs 8 instances)
  - ALB: **no inter-AZ data charges**
  - NLB/GWLB: **charges apply** for inter-AZ traffic

- 🚫 **With XZLB OFF**
  - Each LB node sends traffic **only to targets in its AZ**
  - Client traffic split by LB nodes → can cause imbalance if AZs differ in target count

![From Udemy course - Ultimate AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate](images/cross-zone-load-balancing.png)


- ⚙️ **Defaults & Charges**
  - **ALB**: XZLB **ON by default**  
    - Can override per **Target Group** (force ON/OFF)  
    - No inter-AZ data charge
  - **NLB / GWLB**: XZLB **OFF by default**  
    - Enabling = 💰 inter-AZ data charges
  - **CLB**: XZLB OFF by default; enabling = **no charge** (legacy)

- 📝 **Exam Tips**
  - ALB = XZLB always available + free  
  - NLB/GWLB = enabling may incur cost  
  - XZLB ensures even distribution across uneven AZ capacity
