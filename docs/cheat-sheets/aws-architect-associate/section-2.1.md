## EC2 Essentials
- 💻 **EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud** → core IaaS service  
- 🖥️ **EC2 Instance:** virtual machine you rent  
- 📦 **Main Components:**  
  - EBS volumes (network storage)  
  - Instance Store (hardware storage)  
  - ELB (load balancing)  
  - ASG (auto-scaling)  

### Instance Configuration
- 🐧 OS choices: Linux (most common), Windows, macOS  
- ⚙️ Choose: CPU, RAM, storage type, network performance  
- 🔥 **Security Groups:** instance-level firewall  
- 🌐 Public IP may change on stop/start; private IP stays  

### EC2 User Data (Bootstrap)
- 📜 Runs **once at first boot**  
- Automates: updates, package installs, file creation  
- Runs as **root**  

### Launching an EC2 Instance (Key SAA Points)
- Choose AMI → e.g., Amazon Linux 2 (free tier)  
- Choose instance type → **t2.micro / t3.micro** (free tier)  
- 🔑 Create/choose SSH key pair (.pem / .ppk)  
- Configure security group:  
  - SSH (22) from anywhere  
  - HTTP (80) for web server  
- Add EBS root volume (default 8 GB gp2, delete-on-terminate = yes)  
- Add User Data script to auto-install web server  

### Public vs Private IP
- 🌍 Public IP changes after stop/start  
- 🛠️ Private IP remains stable  
- Access web server via:  
  - `http://<public-ip>` (NOT https)

### Instance Lifecycle
- ▶️ **Start** = VM becomes active  
- ⏹️ **Stop** = VM off (no compute billing, EBS billed)  
- ❌ **Terminate** = delete instance + root volume (if enabled)

### Exam Tips
- EC2 fundamentals are **core SAA topics**  
- Security Groups = **stateful**  
- User Data = **one-time run**, good for automation  
- Public IP volatility → use **Elastic IP** if persistence needed  

## EC2 Instance Types

**EC2 Instance Types**
- 🧩 **Naming:** m5.2xlarge  
  - Letter = class (M=general, C=compute, R=memory…)  
  - Number = generation  
  - Size = resources (CPU/RAM ↑ with size)

**Main Families**
- ⚖️ **General Purpose (T/M/A):** balanced CPU/RAM/network  
  - Use cases: web servers, repos  
  - Free tier: t2.micro / t3.micro  
- 🚀 **Compute Optimized (C):** high CPU  
  - Use cases: batch jobs, transcoding, HPC, ML inferencing, gaming  
- 🧠 **Memory Optimized (R/X/Z):** large in-memory datasets  
  - Use cases: DBs (SQL/NoSQL), BI, in-memory cache, realtime big data  
- 📦 **Storage Optimized (I/D/H):** high I/O local storage  
  - Use cases: OLTP, NoSQL DBs, data warehouses, distributed FS

**Exam Tips**
- Match instance family ↔ workload type  
- Larger sizes = more vCPU + RAM  
- Use AWS docs or **[instances.vantage.sh](https://instances.vantage.sh/)** to compare specs & pricing  

## EC2 Security Groups (Firewall Rules)

- 🔒 **Instance-level firewall** (inbound + outbound)
- ✅ **Allow rules only** (no deny rules)
- 🌍 Rules allow IP ranges (IPv4/IPv6) or **other SGs** (SG-to-SG)

### Core Concepts
- Inbound = traffic **into** EC2  
- Outbound = traffic **from** EC2 → internet  
- SGs operate **outside** the instance → blocked traffic never reaches EC2  
- SGs are **stateful** → return traffic automatically allowed  
- SGs are tied to **Region + VPC**

### Usage & Best Practices
- EC2 can have **multiple SGs**; SGs can be attached to **many instances**
- Maintain a **dedicated SSH SG** for clean security
- **Timeout = SG issue**  
- **Connection refused = app/OS issue**, SG allowed traffic
- Use SG references for **clean architecture** (e.g., Load Balancer SG → EC2 SG)

### Exam-Relevant Ports
- 🔑 **22** – SSH (Linux) / SFTP  
- 📁 **21** – FTP  
- 🌐 **80** – HTTP  
- 🔐 **443** – HTTPS  
- 🪟 **3389** – RDP (Windows)

### Rules Structure
- Fields: **Type · Protocol · Port · Source**
- `0.0.0.0/0` = allow from **anywhere**
- Outbound: **allow all** by default  
- Inbound: **deny all** by default

### Common Patterns
- SG1 inbound allows **SG2** → any instance with SG2 can reach SG1  
- Useful for **ALB → EC2**, **App → DB**, **EC2 → EC2**

### Troubleshooting Tip
- ⏳ **Timeout** = missing inbound rule  
- Add correct port (e.g., 22, 80, 443) → connection restored

## EC2 Instance Connect (Browser-Based SSH)

### Overview
- 🌐 **Browser-based SSH session** directly from the AWS console  
- 🔑 **No need to manage SSH keys** → AWS uploads a **temporary key** automatically  
- 👤 Default username: **ec2-user** (Amazon Linux 2)

### How It Works
- Open **EC2 Console → Instance → Connect**
- Choose **EC2 Instance Connect** (not SSH client)
- AWS:
  - Verifies public IP
  - Uploads a **one-time SSH key**
  - Opens a browser terminal

### Benefits
- 🧩 No key files, no terminal setup  
- 💻 Works on Windows / Mac / Linux equally  
- 🚀 Quick access for demos & troubleshooting

### Commands You Can Run
- `whoami`  
- `ping google.com`  
- Any Linux command supported by the AMI

### Security Group Requirements
- Requires **port 22 (SSH)** inbound  
  - 🌍 **0.0.0.0/0** for IPv4 (common in demos)  
  - 🔢 Add **::/0** if using IPv6  
- If port 22 is removed → ❌ **EC2 Instance Connect will fail**

### Troubleshooting
- ❌ **Connection error?**  
  - Check SG inbound for **SSH (22)**  
  - Add IPv4 + IPv6 entries if needed  
- ✔ After fixing SG rules → reconnect via the console

## Using IAM Roles with EC2 Instances

### Core Idea
- 🔐 **Never** put Access Keys in EC2 (`aws configure` = ❌)
- ✔ EC2 must use **IAM Roles** for temporary credentials

### Steps
- Connect via 🖥️ EC2 Instance Connect or SSH  
- Run AWS CLI → `aws iam list-users` → ❗ No credentials  
- Attach role:  
  EC2 Console → Instance → Actions → Security → **Modify IAM role** → select role → Save

### After Role Attachment
- `aws iam list-users` → ✔ Works if policy allows  
- Detach policy → ❌ AccessDenied  
- ⏱ Policy changes may take a few seconds

### Key Points
- 🧩 IAM Role = secure, automatic credentials  
- 🔄 No need to manage keys  
- 🚫 Never store Access Keys on instances

- ✔ Batch, data analysis, render, flexible timing
- ❌ Not for critical apps or DBs

### Dedicated Host
- 🏢 Entire physical server dedicated to you
- 📜 Required for BYOL/per-core/per-socket licensing
- 💵 Most expensive (physical hardware control)

### Dedicated Instances
- 🧩 Hardware isolated from other customers
- ❌ No placement control
- ✔ Less strict than dedicated hosts

### Capacity Reservations
- 📍 Reserve capacity in an AZ (any duration)
- ❗ No discount (pay on-demand rates even unused)
- ✔ Guarantee capacity for critical, short-term needs
- ➕ Can combine with RI/Savings Plans for discounts

### Quick Selection Tips
- 🕒 **Unpredictable** → On-Demand  
- 🔁 **Steady DB** → Reserved Instance  
- 💵 **Commit to spend, flexible sizes** → Savings Plan  
- ⚡ **Cheap & interruptible** → Spot  
- 🏢 **Compliance/BYOL** → Dedicated Host  
- 📍 **Guaranteed AZ capacity** → Capacity Reservation

## EC2 Spot Instances & Spot Fleets

### Spot Instances
- ⚡ Up to **90% discount** vs On-Demand
- 💵 Define **max spot price** → instance runs if current < max
- ⏱ 2-min **grace period** when reclaimed → stop or terminate
- ⬜ Spot Block → 1–6 hrs guaranteed no interruption (deprecated)
- ✔ Best for **batch, data analysis, fault-tolerant workloads**
- ❌ Not for critical apps/DB

### Spot Pricing
- 💹 Varies per AZ & over time
- 🖤 Max price ensures instance retention
- 📊 Huge cost savings vs On-Demand

### Spot Request Types
- 🔹 **One-time** → launch once, request disappears
- 🔹 **Persistent** → maintains target capacity, auto-relaunch

### Terminating Spot Instances
1. Cancel **spot request** first
2. Terminate associated instances  
- ⚠ Wrong order → AWS relaunches instances

### Spot Fleets
- 🚢 Combine multiple spot & optional On-Demand instances
- 🎯 Meets **target capacity** within price constraints
- 🏷 Allocation strategies:
  - Lowest price → cheapest pool (exam focus)
  - Diversified → spread across pools (availability)
  - Capacity optimized → optimal AZ capacity
  - Price + capacity optimized → best of both worlds
- ✔ Auto-selects instance types & AZs for cost optimization

### Exam Tips
- Understand **spot vs on-demand** vs **spot fleets**
- Know **max price**, **grace period**, **request types**
- Spot fleets → best for **multi-AZ, cost-optimized workloads**

## EC2 Launch Methods & Options
